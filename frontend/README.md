# Event Booking Frontend

This is a minimal React + Vite scaffold for the Event Booking System.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Notes

- The frontend expects the backend to be available at the same origin (relative `/api/*` paths). You can run the backend on port 5000 and configure a proxy in development if needed.
- This is a lightweight scaffold — add styling, proper auth handling, and state management as next steps.
